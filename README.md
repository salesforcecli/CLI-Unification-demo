# plugin-&lt;REPLACE ME&gt;

Change above to <REPLACE_ME> before finalizing

&lt;REPLACE ME DESCRIPTION START&gt;

This repository provides a template for creating a plugin for the Salesforce CLI. To convert this template to a working plugin:

1. Clone this repo
2. Delete the .git folder
3. Replace filler values
   a) Every instance of `<REPLACE_ME>` can be directly substitued for the name of the new plugin. However beware, things like github paths are for the salesforcecli Github organization
   b) Search for case-matching `REPLACE` to find other filler values, such as for the plugin description
4. Use `git init` to set up the desired git information
5. Follow the getting started steps below until the `sfdx hello:org` commmand is functioning

&lt;REPLACE ME DESCRIPTION END&gt;

## Learn about the plugin-template

Salesforce CLI plugins are based on the [oclif plugin framework](<(https://oclif.io/docs/introduction.html)>). Read the [plugin developer guide](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_cli_plugins.meta/sfdx_cli_plugins/cli_plugins_architecture_sf_cli.htm) to learn about Salesforce CLI plugin development.

This repository contains a lot of additional scripts and tools to help with general Salesforce node development and enforce coding standards. You should familiarize yourself with some of the [node developer packages](https://github.com/forcedotcom/sfdx-dev-packages/) used by Salesforce. There is also a default circleci config using the [release management orb](https://github.com/forcedotcom/npm-release-management-orb) standards.

Additionally, there are some additional tests that the Salesforce CLI will enforce if this plugin is ever bundled with the CLI. These test are included by default under the `posttest` script and it is recommended to keep these tests active in your plugin, regardless if you plan to have it bundled.

# Everything past here is only a suggestion as to what should be in your specific plugin's description

This plugin is bundled with the [Salesforce CLI](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/sfdxcli). For more information on the CLI, read the [getting started guide](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_intro.htm).

We always recommend using the latest version of these commands bundled with the CLI, however, you can install a specific version or tag if needed.

## Install

```bash
sfdx plugins:install <REPLACE_ME>@x.y.z
```

### Build

To build the plugin locally, make sure to have yarn installed and run the following commands:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:salesforcecli/plugin-<REPLACE_ME>

# Install the dependencies and compile
yarn install
yarn build
```

To use your plugin, run using the local `./bin/run` or `./bin/run.cmd` file.

```bash
# Run using local run file.
./bin/run <REPLACE_ME>
```

There should be no differences when running via the Salesforce CLI or using the local run file. However, it can be useful to link the plugin to do some additional testing or run your commands from anywhere on your machine.

```bash
# Link your plugin to the sfdx cli
sfdx plugins:link .
# To verify
sfdx plugins
```
